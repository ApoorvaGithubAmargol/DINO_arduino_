# DINO_arduino_
I was really fascinated by this project of playing chrome dino game using servo.
I did have to change the speed of the chrome dino using "console" in chrome inorder to reduce the speed, and i also had to vary the delay in my code to jump at the tight time.
You have to check the resistance value and change the if loop, and delay respectively.
(See the working in the video attached)

Circuit diagram-
- One end of LDR was connected to analog pin- A0 and ground via resistor 1000 ohms.
- other end was connected to 5v
- Servo motor was connected to pin 9.

working-

NOTE: PLEASE CAREFULLY SEE THAT I AM JUST HOLDING THE MOTOR TO KEEP IT IN PLACE AS I CANNOT ATTACH THE MOTOR TO MY KEYBOARD. SERVO PRESSES THE KEY ON ITS OWN.

Bloopers:
You can see that i had not adjusted the delay properly so dino jumped prior to required time.
